#  relative  

A length in relation to some known length.
 

This type is a combination of a [length] with a [ratio]. It results from addition and subtraction of a length and a ratio. Wherever a relative length is expected, you can also use a bare length or ratio.
 

## Relative to the page 

A common use case is setting the width or height of a layout element (e.g., [block], [rect], etc.) as a certain percentage of the width of the page. Here, the rectangle's width is set to `25%`, so it takes up one fourth of the page's inner width (the width minus margins).
 
```
#rect(width: 25%)

```
 

Bare lengths or ratios are always valid where relative lengths are expected, but the two can also be freely mixed:
 
```
#rect(width: 25% + 1cm)

```
 

If you're trying to size an element so that it takes up the page's full width, you have a few options (this highly depends on your exact use case):
  Set page margins to `0pt` (`#set page(margin: 0pt)`)
 Multiply the ratio by the known full page width (`21cm * 69%`)
 Use padding which will negate the margins (`#pad(x: -2.5cm, ...)`)
 Use the page [background] or [foreground] field as those don't take margins into account (note that it will render the content outside of the document flow, see [place] to control the content position)
  

## Relative to a container 

When a layout element (e.g. a [rect]) is nested in another layout container (e.g. a [block]) instead of being a direct descendant of the page, relative widths become relative to the container:
 
```
#block(
  width: 100pt,
  fill: aqua,
  rect(width: 50%),
)

```
 

## Scripting 

You can multiply relative lengths by [ratios], [integers], and [floats].
 

A relative length has the following fields:
  `length`: Its [length] component.
 `ratio`: Its [ratio] component.
  
```
#(100% - 50pt).length \
#(100% - 50pt).ratio

```
