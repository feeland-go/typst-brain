#  module  

A collection of variables and functions that are commonly related to a single theme.
 

A module can
  be built-in
 stem from a [file import]
 stem from a [package import] (and thus indirectly its entrypoint file)
 result from a call to the [plugin] function
  

You can access definitions from the module using [field access notation] and interact with it using the [import and include syntaxes].
 
```
#import "utils.typ"
#utils.add(2, 5)

#import utils: sub
#sub(1, 4)

```
 

You can check whether a definition is present in a module using the `in` operator, with a string on the left-hand side. This can be useful to [conditionally access] definitions in a module.
 
```
#("table" in std) \
#("nope" in std)

```
 

Alternatively, it is possible to convert a module to a dictionary, and therefore access its contents dynamically, using the [dictionary constructor].
