# HTML  

Typst's HTML export is currently under active development. The feature is still very incomplete and only available for experimentation behind a feature flag. Do not use this feature for production use cases. In the CLI, you can experiment with HTML export by passing `--features html` or setting the `TYPST_FEATURES` environment variables to `html`. Visit the [tracking issue] to follow progress on HTML export and learn more about planned features.
  

HTML files describe a document structurally. The aim of Typst's HTML export is to capture the structure of an input document and produce semantically rich HTML that retains this structure. The resulting HTML should be accessible, human-readable, and editable by hand and downstream tools.
 

PDF, PNG, and SVG export, in contrast, all produce visual representations of a fully-laid out document. This divergence in the formats' intents means that Typst cannot simply produce perfect HTML for your existing Typst documents. It cannot always know what the best semantic HTML representation of your content is.
 

Instead, it gives you full control: You can check the current export format through the [`target`] function and when it is set to HTML, generate [raw HTML elements]. The primary intended use of these elements is in templates and show rules. This way, the document's contents can be fully agnostic to the export target and content can be shared between PDF and HTML export.
 

Currently, Typst will always output a single HTML file. Support for outputting directories with multiple HTML documents and assets, as well as support for outputting fragments that can be integrated into other HTML documents is planned.
 

Typst currently does not output CSS style sheets, instead focussing on emitting semantic markup. You can of course write your own CSS styles and still benefit from sharing your content between PDF and HTML. For the future, we plan to give you the option of automatically emitting CSS, taking more of your existing set rules into account.
 

## Exporting as HTML 

### Command Line 

Pass `--format html` to the `compile` or `watch` subcommand or provide an output file name that ends with `.html`. Note that you must also pass `--features html` or set `TYPST_FEATURES=html` to enable this experimental export target.
 

When using `typst watch`, Typst will spin up a live-reloading HTTP server. You can configure it as follows:
  Pass `--port` to change the port. (Defaults to the first free port in the range 3000-3005.)
 Pass `--no-reload` to disable injection of a live reload script. (The HTML that is written to disk isn't affected either way.)
 Pass `--no-serve` to disable the server altogether.
  

### Web App 

HTML can be enabled as an experimental feature in the web app. For more details on how to use it, you can refer to [the dedicated documentation on HTML export in the web app].
 

## HTML-specific functionality 

Typst exposes HTML-specific functionality in the global `html` module. See below for the definitions it contains.
 

## Definitions  [ `elem` ] An HTML element that can contain Typst content. 
 [ `frame` ] An element that lays out its content as an inline SVG. 
 [ typed ] A typed layer over raw HTML elements.
