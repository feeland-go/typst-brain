# Data Loading (data-loading)

Data loading from external files.

## Overview

Reference Data Loading Data Loading Data loading from external files. These functions help you with loading and embedding data, for example from the results of an experiment. Encoding Some of the functions are also capable of encoding, e.g. cbor.encode. They facilitate passing structured data to plugins. However, each data format has its own native types. Therefore, for an arbitrary Typst value, the encode-to-decode roundtrip might be lossy. In general, numbers, strings, and arrays or dictionaries composed of them can be reliably converted, while other types may fall back to strings via repr, which is for debugging purposes only. Please refer to the page of each data format for details. Definitions cbor Reads structured data from a CBOR file. csv Reads structured data from a CSV file. json Reads structured data from a JSON file. read Reads plain text or data from a file. toml Reads structured data from a TOML file. xml Reads structured data from an XML file. yaml Reads structured data from a YAML file.
